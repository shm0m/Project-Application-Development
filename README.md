# DietEthic Application

## Overview
DietEthic is a health-focused application designed to help users monitor their dietary habits and manage their nutritional needs. The application dynamically calculates calorie requirements based on user inputs such as weight history, weight goals, and physical activities. The backend is powered by **Firebase** for real-time data storage and management.

## Features
- **Dynamic Calorie Calculator**: Adjusts daily calorie needs based on weight goals and activity levels.
- **Firebase Integration**: Secure real-time database for user profiles, weight logs, and activity history.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless user experience.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can visualize weight trends and progress towards their goals.
- **Customizable Goals**: Set personalized weight loss, gain, or maintenance targets.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Frameworks**: React (if applicable)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shm0m/DietEthic.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
